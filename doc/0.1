0.1.0-rc1
=========

This release was focussed on the first component, which is responsible for
communications with the OpenTTD admin port.

Quick summary of the component openttd-adminport.js:

    Supported methods free to use:
        "on", "getUpdates", "poll", "rcon", "gamescript", "disconnect",
        "sendPacket" (prefered internal use only)

    Methods of which may be deprecated any time:
        "getLIstFrequencies"

    Properties accessible for reading:
        "commands", "companies", "clients"

    Supported events you can use with the "on" method:
        "welcome", "end", "error", "protocol", "log", "console",
        "date", "chat", "rcon", "cmdNames", "cmdLogging", "gamescript",

        "clientJoin", "clientUpdate", "clientInfo", "clientQuit", "clientError",

        "companyNew", "companyUpdate", "companyInfo", "companyRemove",
        "companyEconomy", "companyStats"

This component is shipped with a demo app that can be used as reference.
This app is also currently used to do basic testing with the api.

Few remarks:
  - The api is not stable, everything can change with every update to come.
      Though removing parts of the api may be announced before removing.

  - 64-bit integers handling is not yet considered stable.
      Company information about economics and chat data are using 64-bit data.

  - Configuration is hardcoded to settings.js.
       Hopefully this will be changed soonly.

  - Polling all clients or companies may not work as it simply didn't work
      for me (yet).
